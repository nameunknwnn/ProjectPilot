# ProjectPilot

ProjectPilot is an AI-powered platform that simplifies the process of creating web applications. This project leverages cutting-edge AI capabilities to assist users in generating, editing, and previewing code for their web applications. The platform is built using **Next.js** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

- **frontend/**: Contains the Next.js code for the user interface.
- **backend/**: Contains the Node.js code that handles server-side operations, including GPT-powered prompts.

## Features

### AI Assistance
- Utilizes GPT to provide intelligent prompts and suggestions for building web applications.

### Integrated Code Editor
- Users can write, edit, and customize their application code directly in the platform.

### Real-Time Preview
- A live preview of the application is displayed using web containers, enabling users to see changes as they code.

### Chat Support
- A chat interface allows users to interact with the AI for additional help, debugging, or feature suggestions.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **AI Engine**: GPT API
- **Web Containers**: For live application previews
